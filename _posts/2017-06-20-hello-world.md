Hello there! Call me Zeta, and welcome to my scale modelling blog Zeta Plamo! I’m an avid builder and collector of scale models, specifically Gunpla which are **Gun**dam **pla**stic model kits. I hope you’ll stick around and check out my modelling exploits, be it giant robots or otherwise! Look out for more posts soon, cheers!
